                <p>What it means to own a Praying Hands Club NFT.</p>
                <p>i. You own the NFT. Each Praying Hand is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Praying Hand, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Praying Hand.
                    <span class="pera-gap"> class="pera-gap"> ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yump Creative LLC grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Praying Hand / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display the Art for their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Praying Hand, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display the Art for their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Praying Hand leaves the website/application.</span>
                    
                   <span class="pera-gap">iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yump Creative LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Praying Hands generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display the Art for their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Praying Hands generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display the Art for their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the purchased Praying Hand leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</span></p>
